# Lab 8 - Starter

Question 1.  Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.

1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. 

Running automated tests through Github Action allows for immediate feedback on the code changes. It helps identify issues or bugs in the development cycle, enabling faster resolution and reducing the chances of introducing new bugs.

no

Question 3.Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

I will not use unit test to test it. Since "message" feature should be interactive, it cannot give feedback that show if it work properly with other part of the software.
